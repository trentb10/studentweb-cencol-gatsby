# Trent B on Gatsby!

*Trent B on Gatsby!* is a GatsbyJS implementation of my personal website that 
was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was hosted on 
[Centennial College's Student Web server](http://studentweb.cencol.ca/)!

[*trentb10 on GitHub Pages*](https://trentb10.github.io/studentweb-cencol-github-pages/) 
is a GitHub Pages implementation of my personal website that is used to host my
assignments for COMP213 Web Interface Design and COMP125 Client-Side Development
at Centennial College. I had planned to host all features of my personal website
on GitHub pages before I decided to use GatsbyJS instead.

This repository is used to host the website on the GatsbyJS cloud.

# Release Notes

# Branch Notes

As soon as Trent B on Gatsby! reaches Version 1.0 release, there will be two 
branches set up to manage the project the rest of the way:

* `main`: The main branch of the project repository that will be used to publish 
the website on the cloud
* `development`: The development branch of the project repository. All changes 
new features will be developed and pushed to this branch before being released 
and pushed to the `main` branch.
