        Now that I've given an overview of my experiences, I will go into further
        detail about myself, including which programming languages, frameworks/
        libraries, and IDEs and office suites I'm proficient in!
      </p>

      <p>
        To measure my proficiency, I used a skillbox with my own defined scale:
      </p>

      <p>
        1 - Willing to Learn More! I've used it for a little bit and I can do
        some basic stuff with it, but I'm not as proficient and comfortable 
        with it as the others as much as I like. I'm willing to devote some 
        time and learn more about it so I can become more proficient and familiar 
        with it!
      </p>

      <p>
        2 - Familiar! I've used it and had some practice with it, allowing me to
        build some small/medium projects. In some cases I haven't used it in a 
        long time, or I still think there's more to learn, but a little refresher 
        or a review will help me become more proficient with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        3 - Fairly Proficient! I've used it for a good amount of time and I've 
        built a number of projects with it. With a given language/framework, I 
        can visualize/sketch out a task and have an idea of how I want to 
        approach the task before I go and write out the code.
      </p>

      <p>
        4 - Very Proficient! I'm so good with it I can use it with my eyes closed!
      </p>

      <h2>My Proficiencies in Programming Languages</h2>

      <p>
        Here is an in-depth list of languages I have used before.

              The earliest exposure I had to HTML was building web pages through 
              web development tools. In high school, I built a web site using Dreamweaver!
              I wish I had saved this site, but it was on a flash drive that became 
              corrupted ðŸ˜­. All I can tell you about that site was that it was about 
              Katy Perry...
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time I built a web site using a text editor was for Centennial 
              College, when I wrote HTML code for COMP213 Assignment 1 in Sublime 
              Text! I'm pretty comfortable writing HTML in text editors, as I'm 
              doing so right now for this web site in VS Code!
            </p>
          </div>
        </Collapsible>
        <Collapsible
          trigger={css}

          <div class="skillbox-skill-info">
            <p>
              I can't remember whether I used CSS with that Katy Perry website I 
              made for high school. Although COMP213 Assignment 1 didn't use CSS 
              and was just styled using the style attribute, I did learn to use 
              CSS afterward, and I re-coded Assignment 1 to use styles from a CSS 
              file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Out of all the parts regarding web design, I consider writing CSS 
              to be the most fun. I enjoy adding attributes to elements and classes 
              and watching the web site "come alive."
            </p>
            <p>
              Something I've had to build from scratch using CSS is this skill box, 
              for example. I didn't really like most of the examples on the web 
              because they didn't really fit what I was looking for in a skill box. 
              I didn't want to use progress bars with percentages because I don't 
              think that's an appropriate way to gouge how good a programmer is 
              with a language. I wanted a skill box with my own scale defined, 
              and I wanted to make it possible for the user to click on a skill 
              so the description container is expanded and the user can read 
              a little more of what I have to say about it. For this, I've used 
              a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-collapsible">React
              plugin</a> for collapsibles, the same plugin I used for the <Link
              to="/assignments">Assignments</Link> page as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I sketched out how I wanted my skill box to look like, I began 
              building it from scratch with CSS. You can see my sketches in the 
              Works &#62; Personal Works section!

              I didn't learn JavaScript until my second term at Centennial College,
              but it has quickly become one of my favourite languages, along with 
              HTML, CSS, and Java. I am comfortable programming in JS for client-side 
              web development as well as for non-browser applications. During my 
              last term at Centennial College, I have programmed in Node.js to build 
              applications using the Express.js framework and the React library.

              I have been learning and developing Java applications since high school.
              throughout high-school and my third term at Centennial College, I 
              have programmed Java console applications. In the following terms, 
              I used Java to build Android applications in Android Studio as well 
              as web applications using Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

              C# was the language I've learned and used for the majority of my academic 
              career at Centennial College. Among the kinds of applications I have
              developed using C# include console applications, windows forms, WPF 
              forms, and web applications. I've also used C# in Unity for COMP397 
              Web Game Programming, in which my group and I developed <i>Robo

              Visual Basic .NET is another programming language I have learned in
              high school! Some of the applications I remember developing include
              a simple calculator and a BMI calculator. Although it's been roughly
              ten years since I've used VB, I would appreciate any opportunity to 
              develop in VB again!

              I have used ActionScript to make some Flash games during my last 
              semester in high school. Although there aren't opportunities to 
              use ActionScript today, I just wanted to point out that I've used

              I was fortunate to have learned Python in a course at Centennial College
              that wasn't actually dedicated to Python. It was a course on Linux 
              systems and I didn't learn Python until the second half of the course.
            </p>
            <p>    
              The most I did with Python was write basic console applications, as 
              well as running and modifying code for lab assignments for COMP309 
              Data Warehouse & Mining. 
            </p>

              Although I don't have much experience with Python as I'd like to, 
              I aim to find more learning opportunities so I can practice Python 
              as much as I can and become proficient with it! I've recently enrolled
