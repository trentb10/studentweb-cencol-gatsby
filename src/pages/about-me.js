              The earliest exposure I had to HTML was building web pages through web
              development tools. In high school, I built a web site using Dreamweaver!
              I wish I had saved this site, but it was on a flash drive that became 
              corrupted ðŸ˜­. All I can tell you about that site was that it was about 
              Katy Perry...
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time I built a web site using a text editor was for Centennial 
              College, when I wrote HTML code for COMP213 Assignment 1 in Sublime Text!
              I'm pretty comfortable writing HTML in text editors, as I'm doing so 
              right now for this web site in VS Code!

              I can't remember whether I used CSS with that Katy Perry website I made 
              for high school. Although COMP213 Assignment 1 didn't use CSS and was
              just styled using the style attribute, I did learn to use CSS afterward,
              and I re-coded Assignment 1 to use styles from a CSS file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Out of all the parts regarding web design, I consider writing CSS to be
              the most fun. I feel a lot of pleasure adding attributes to elements
              and classes and watching the web site "come alive."
            </p>
            <p>
              Take a look at this skill box, for example. I didn't really like most 
              of the examples on the web because they didn't really fit what I was 
              looking for in a skill box. I didn't want to use progress bars with 
              percentages because I don't think that's an appropriate  way to gouge 
              how good a programmer is with a language. I wanted a skill box with my 
              own scale defined. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I sketched out how I wanted my skill box to look like, I began 
              building it from scratch with CSS. You can see my sketches in the 
              Works &#62; Personal Works section!

              I didn't learn JavaScript until my second term at Centennial College,
              but it has quickly become one of my favourite languages, along with HTML,
              CSS, and Java. I am comfortable programming in JS for client-side web 
              development as well as for non-browser applications. During my last term
              at Centennial College, I have programmed in Node.js to build applications
              using the Express.js framework and the React library.

              Java is the first programming language I have academically learned, and 
              that makes it the first object-oriented language I have learned. Throughout
              high-school and my third term at Centennial College, I have programmed
              Java console applications. In the following terms, I used Java to build 
              Android applications in Android Studio as well as web applications using 
              Spring MVC and Spring Boot.

              C# was the language I've learned and used for the majority of my academic 
              career at Centennial College. I have built a lot of console applications
              as well as a few web applications that use the .net core framework.

              I was fortunate to have learned Python in a course at Centennial College
              that wasn't actually dedicated to Python. It was a course on Linux systems
              and I didn't learn Python until the second half of the course.
            </p>
            <p>    
              The most I did with Python was write basic console applications, as well
              as running and modifying code for lab assignments for COMP309 Data 
              Warehouse & Mining. 
            </p>
            <p>    
              Although I don't have much experience with Python as I'd like to, I aim 
              to find more learning opportunities so I can practice Python as much as 
              I can and become proficient with it!
