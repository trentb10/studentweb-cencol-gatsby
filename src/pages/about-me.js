                            I am very proficient in HTML. I've built static web pages using HTML
                            ever since I was in high school. My first web site project was built
                            using HTML and Dreamweaver! I wish I had saved this site, but it was
                            on a flash drive with all of my other high school assignments that 
                            became corrupted ðŸ˜­. All I can tell you about that site was that it
                            was about Katy Perry...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe the first time I built a website without using a web 
                            development tool was for Centennial College, when I wrote the code for 
                            COMP213 Assignment 1 in Sublime Text 3! Although it initially felt
                            daunting to build a website without any of the usual tools I'd use in
                            Dreamweaver and FrontPage, I was able to learn a lot about the different
                            kinds of HTML tags used to create elements on a page. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am most comfortable writing HTML in text editors. Currently, I write
                            HTML in Visual Studio Code, as I'm doing right now with this website!
                        </p>

                </Collapsible>
                <Collapsible

                >
                    <div class="skillbox-skill-info">
                        <p>
                            As my learning and experience grew with HTML, so did with CSS, too. I 
                            can't remember whether I used CSS with that Katy Perry website I made 
                            for high school. Although COMP213 Assignment 1 didn't use CSS and was
                            just styled using the style attribute, I did learn to use CSS afterward,
                            and I re-coded Assignment 1 to use styles from a CSS file.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I consider writing CSS to be such a pleasing task. It's very laid-back 
                            for me because I like to put so much care into how a web page 
                            aesthetically looks. I like to play around with different attributes and
                            values until I get a specific element to look exactly the way I want,
                            and that it blends in very well with the rest of the website.

                            I didn't learn JavaScript until my second term at Centennial College,
                            but it has quickly become one of my favourite languages, along with HTML,
                            CSS, and Java. I improved my JS proficiency during my last term, when
                            I began learning about node.js and building apps using Express.js and
                            React.js.

                            C# was the language I've learned and used for the majority of my academic

                            as well as a few web applications that use the .net core framework.
