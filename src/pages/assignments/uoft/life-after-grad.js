            <h2><i>Life After Grad</i>: A term documentary project</h2>

            <p>
                <i>Life After Grad</i> (2018) is a documentary film that focuses 
                on four university students as they share their thoughts, plans, 
                and fears about graduating from university and their life post-graduation. 
                The documentary was a term project for the course ENGD94 Stranger 
                Than Fiction at the University of Toronto and the film's editing, 
                as well as most of the film's musical score, was done by yours truly!

            <h3>Equipment Used</h3>

            <p>
                Some of the software and hardware equipment I have used to film 
                and edit the documentary include:
                <li>Camera: LG G4</li>
                <li>Audio Production: FL Studio</li>
                <li>Video Production: DaVinci Resolve</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                The documentary was screened at an <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/reel-scarborough-documentary-series-event-tickets-toronto-D04KQY"
                    target="_blank">event</a> a few months later.

            <h3>Reflection Piece</h3>

            <p>
                As part of the submission for the documentary I also wrote a reflection
                piece. Here are some excerpts* of what I wrote:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    My overall experience with the documentary project has been 
                    great. I was able to gain a lot of insight with how a documentary 
                    is made and the development process that goes along with it. 
                    I think the last time I have undertaken a video project with 
                    classmates was about ten years ago, when I was attending elementary 
                    school.<sup>1</sup>
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of the style, although we initially deecided to do 
                    a video diary style, it ended up being a hybrid between an 
                    interview and video diary style, depending on which student
                    was sharing their thoughts with the camera/interviewer. This
                    style allowed the different personalities to shine, since each
                    person is unique and each person experiences university differently.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In terms of challenges with the project, I definitely struggled 
                    with camera shyness and initially I wondered how I was going 
                    to gather the courage and get myself interviewed for this documentary 
                    project. After I admitted to my group members I didnâ€™t want 
                    to be on camera, I felt it would be a fair compromise if I became 
                    editor for the documentary, especially since I already have 
                    experience with video editing.
                </p>

                <p> 
                    I canâ€™t remember the last time I was this enthusiastic for a 
                    university assignment. I have felt very sluggish for every other 
                    assignment. Just last Saturday night, I was watching the conclusion 
                    of the Raptors game and usually, in these kinds of situations, Iâ€™d 
                    I'd feel impending doom for completing a big assignment that's due
                    soon, because once the game is over I'd have nothing else to 
                    do but to complete it. This time, however, it was different. 
                    I felt like I couldnâ€™t wait to continue the project. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like a dedicated artist I stayed up all night editing. 
                    Although I tried to sleep at 6am, the only thing I could think 
                    about was the documentary and how Iâ€™d fix the flow of it, and 
                    then I was half awake/half dreaming about clips Iâ€™ve never received. 
                    When I woke up I found out I only slept for two hours and my 
                    brain was still buzzing, so I figured with another two full 
                    days until the midnight deadline Iâ€™d work more on it.

                <sup>*</sup> I've revised and edited some of these excerpts, so 
                they might not be verbatim of what I actually wrote in the submitted
                document.

                made for an overnight trip to Camp Olympia when I was in the seventh 
                grade.
