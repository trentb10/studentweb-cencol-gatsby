		<h2>Welcome to my home page!</h2>
			
		<p>
			I am a graduate from Centennial College with an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology and 
			from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Media Studies and minoring in 
			English and Psychology.
		</p>

		<p>
			The home page you are looking at right now was built as part as an assignment for COMP213 at Centennial 
			College, and it was hosted on <a href="http://studentweb.cencol.ca/">studentweb.cencol.ca</a>. I have now
			expanded it into my own little site to host some of my past works and assignments I did as a student at 
			Centennial and UofT; a writer with 24OurMusic, Amp the Sound, and Feed My Curiosity, which I 
			am currently writing scripts for; and of course, my resume!
		</p>

		<p>
			This page is looking bland right now, but I hope to dress it up with stuffs like a navigation bar to make 
			this feel more like home.
