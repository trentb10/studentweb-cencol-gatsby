			<h2>Welcome to my home page!</h2>
					
			<p>
				I am a graduate from Centennial College with an Advanced Diploma 
				in Software Engineering Technology and from the University of 
				Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Media 
				Studies and minoring in English and Psychology.
			</p>

			<p>
				The home page you are looking at right now was built as part 
				as <a href="https://trentb10.github.io/studentweb-cencol-github-pages/comp213-002/assignment1/assignment1.html">
				Assignment 1</a> for COMP213 at Centennial College, and it was 
				hosted on <a href="http://studentweb.cencol.ca/">studentweb.cencol.ca</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have now expanded it into my own little site to host some 
				of my past works and assignments I did as a student at Centennial 
				and UofT; a writer with 24OurMusic, Amp the Sound, and Feed My 
				Curiosity, which I am currently writing scripts for; and of 
				course, my resume!
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Get started by using the navbar at the top!
